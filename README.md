## Input Text File Formatting

To input a text file it must be in a certain format. Each line is comma-separated information that represents an account. First is an S, C, or M to represent a savings, checking, or money market account. Then is the first then last name. Then is the balance. Then is the data, and lastly is either a boolean or number, depending on the account type. For a savings account it is a boolean which represents if the account holder is a loyal customer. For checking accounts it is a boolean representing if direct deposit is authorized. And for money market it is an integer representing the amount of times money has been withdrawn. An example file is given called database.txt
